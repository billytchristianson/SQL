-- This project provides insights into city bike lane data using SQL.

-- The data was stored in a table called CityBikeLanes, created and populated to support learning and practice with Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions:

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.CityBikeLanes (
    id integer primary key,
    year_installed year not null,
    year_updated year not null,
    street varchar not null,
    width_feet integer not null,
    safetyrating integer not null,
    protected varchar not null
);

INSERT INTO BIT_DB.CityBikeLanes VALUES
(1, 2012, 2020, 'Chestnut', 4, 4, 'yes'),
(2, 2016, 2020, 'Walnut', 4, 3.8, 'yes'),
(3, 2011, 2020, 'Market', 3.5, 2, 'no'),
(4, 2008, 2020, 'Locust', 4, 5, 'yes'),
(5, 2002, 2020, 'South', 4.5, 4.3, 'no');
-- (Additional data was inserted for a comprehensive dataset)

-- Analysis Questions and SQL Solutions

-- 1. Identifying Bike Lanes with an Average Safety Rating of 4.0 or Higher
-- To list all bike lanes with an average safety rating of 4.0 or higher, a CTE is used to calculate the average safety rating for each street. The main query then selects these results and labels qualifying streets as "Safe Lane."

WITH safety_avg_cte AS (
    SELECT
        street,
        AVG(safetyrating) AS rating
    FROM CityBikeLanes
    GROUP BY street
)
SELECT
    street,
    rating,
    CASE
        WHEN rating >= 4 THEN 'Safe Lane'
        ELSE ''
    END AS label
FROM safety_avg_cte
WHERE rating >= 4
ORDER BY rating DESC;

-- 2. Detailed List of Bike Lanes with Ratings, Averages, and Recommendations
-- This query provides a detailed view of all bike lanes, showing both individual safety ratings and average safety ratings. It also includes a recommendation based on the average rating.

SELECT
    street,
    safetyrating,
    AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) AS avg_rating,
    CASE 
        WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) >= 4 THEN 'Leave As-Is'
        WHEN AVG(safetyrating) OVER (PARTITION BY street) < 2.5 THEN 'Remove'
        ELSE 'Improvements Needed'
    END AS recommendation
FROM CityBikeLanes;

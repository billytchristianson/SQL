-- For this analysis I am working with a dataset called chinook, which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.
-- Below you will find the different requests and analysis I performed on the data.

-- Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM customers 
WHERE Country <> 'USA';

-- Show only the Customers from Brazil
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country
FROM customers 
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';

-- Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil.
-- The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country

       customers.LastName,
       invoices.InvoiceId,
       invoices.InvoiceDate,

-- Show the Employees who are Sales Agents
SELECT FirstName,
       LastName,
       EmployeeId
FROM employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

-- Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry

-- Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent.
-- The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name.

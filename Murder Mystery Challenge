-- SQL Murder Mystery Challenge: https://mystery.knightlab.com/
-- In this challenge, we use SQL commands and the database schema to solve the murder mystery.

-- Thought Process and Solution to the Murder Mystery:

-- Clue 1: The crime was a murder on Jan. 15, 2018, in SQL City.

-- Step 1: Check available tables in the database.
SELECT name 
FROM sqlite_master
WHERE type = 'table';

-- Step 2: Inspect the structure of the `crime_scene_report` table.
SELECT sql 
FROM sqlite_master
WHERE name = 'crime_scene_report';

-- Table Structure: CREATE TABLE crime_scene_report ( date integer, type text, description text, city text );

-- Step 3: Check data in `crime_scene_report` and narrow it to known details (date = Jan 15, 2018, city = SQL City, type = murder).
SELECT description 
FROM crime_scene_report
WHERE date = 20180115
AND type = 'murder'
AND city = 'SQL City';

-- Clue: Security footage shows there were 2 witnesses.
-- Witness 1: Lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr".
-- Witness 2: Named Annabel, lives on "Franklin Ave".

-- Step 4: Identify the person living at the last house on "Northwestern Dr."
SELECT name, id, address_number, address_street_name
FROM person
WHERE address_street_name = 'Northwestern Dr'
ORDER BY address_number DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Witness 1: Morty Schapiro - ID 14887

-- Step 5: Find the ID of Annabel on "Franklin Ave."
SELECT name, id 
FROM person
WHERE name LIKE 'Annabel%'
AND address_street_name = 'Franklin Ave';

-- Witness 2: Annabel Miller - ID 16371

-- Step 6: Read Morty’s interview transcript for more details.
SELECT transcript 
FROM interview
WHERE person_id = 14887;

-- Transcript: Morty saw a man with a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag (membership starts with "48Z" and is for gold members only).
-- The man left in a car with a plate containing "H42W".

-- Step 7: Read Annabel’s interview transcript.
SELECT transcript 
FROM interview
WHERE person_id = 16371;

-- Transcript: Annabel recognized the killer from the gym on Jan 9.

-- Step 8: Identify gym members with IDs starting with "48Z."
SELECT id AS gym_id, name, person_id
FROM get_fit_now_member
WHERE id LIKE '48Z%';

-- Possible Matches:
-- - 48Z38 Tomas Baisley (ID 49550)
-- - 48Z7A Joe Germuska (ID 28819)
-- - 48Z55 Jeremy Bowers (ID 67318)

-- Step 9: Check if these members worked out on Jan 9.
SELECT *
FROM get_fit_now_check_in
WHERE membership_id IN ('48Z38', '48Z7A', '48Z55')
AND check_in_date = '20180109';

-- Possible Suspects Based on Jan 9 Check-ins:
-- - Joe Germuska (ID 28819)
-- - Jeremy Bowers (ID 67318)

-- Step 10: Check interviews of the suspects.
-- Interview of Joe (ID 28819)
SELECT transcript 
FROM interview
WHERE person_id = 28819;

-- No data

-- Interview of Jeremy (ID 67318)
SELECT transcript 
FROM interview
WHERE person_id = 67318;

-- Transcript: Jeremy was hired by a woman around 5'5" or 5'7", with red hair, drives a Tesla Model S, and attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.

-- Step 11: Find IDs of women matching this description.
SELECT id
FROM drivers_license
WHERE height BETWEEN 65 AND 67
AND hair_color = 'red'
AND car_make = 'Tesla'
AND gender = 'female';

-- Possible Suspects by License:
-- - 202298
-- - 291182
-- - 918773

-- Step 12: Find the names of the suspects by ID.
SELECT id, name
FROM person
WHERE license_id IN (202298, 291182, 918773);

-- Possible Suspects:
-- - Red Korb (ID 78881)
-- - Regina George (ID 90700)
-- - Miranda Priestly (ID 99716)

-- Step 13: Identify who attended SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.
SELECT person_id, COUNT(date) AS total_events
FROM facebook_event_checkin
WHERE date BETWEEN 20171201 AND 20171231
AND event_name = 'SQL Symphony Concert'
GROUP BY person_id
HAVING COUNT(date) = 3;

-- Matches:
-- - Person ID 24556 (3 times)
-- - Person ID 99716 (3 times) - Miranda Priestly

-- Conclusion: Miranda Priestly (ID 99716) is the murderer.
